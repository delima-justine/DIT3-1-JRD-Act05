1. How did you implement CRUD using SQLite?
    - I implemented CRUD using SQLite by having another Kotlin class which is DatabaseHelper which manages the connection of my application to the database. It also handles the functions that contains the query of CRUD.
   
2. What challenges did you face in maintaining data persistence?
   - One of the main challenges I faced in maintaining data persistence is logging to logcat terminal to verify if I successfully fetched or inserted the data to/from the database. 
   - Logging become one of the challenges I faced because there is too much logs in the log cat and I can't find my verifier log.
   - After all, I successfully implemented CRUD.
   - I also felt the unfamiliarity with the structure of querying of data in Kotlin since I have been used in querying in our Web Development. 

3. How could you improve performance or UI Design in future versions?
    - I plan to make the UI Design with similar functionality with Google Keep Notes. Their feature in saving notes after edited is it don't need a save button to save the updated note.
    - Google Keep Notes automatically saves the updated note after returning to the application main interface.
